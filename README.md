At the moment this is a first draft, there is still ugly code and things

For you to use you'll have to make a few steps

# Install

```
git clone [project]
npm i
```


# Generate credentials

(with Google's client_id.json inside the project directory)

```
node generate.js
# Open the link in the browser and copy it into bash again
```

# Start using

```
node cli.js
```
